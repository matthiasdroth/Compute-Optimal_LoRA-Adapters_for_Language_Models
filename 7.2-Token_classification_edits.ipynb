    "The first application we'll explore is token classification. This generic task encompasses any problem that can be formulated as \"attributing a label to each token in a sentence\", such as:\n",
    "- **Named entity recognition (NER)**: Find the entities (such as persons, locations, or organizations) in a sentence. This can be formulated as attributing a label to each token by having one class per entity and one class for \"no entity.\"\n",
    "- **Part-of-speech tagging (POS)**: Mark each word in a sentence as corresponding to a particular part of speech (such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.).\n",
    "- **Chunking**: Find the tokens that belong to the same entity. This task (which can be combined with POS or NER) can be formulated as attributing one label (usually B-) to any tokens that are at the beginning of a chunk, another label (usually I-) to tokens that are inside a chunk, and a third label (usually O) to tokens that don't belong to any chunk."

    "The first line is self-explanatory: it tells all the processes to wait until everyone is at that stage before continuing. This is to make sure we have the same model in every process before saving. Then we grab the `unwrapped_model`, which is the base model we defined. The `accelerator.prepare()` method changes the model to work in distributed training, so it won't have the `save_pretrained()` method anymore; the `accelerator.unwrap_model()` method undoes that step. Lastly, we call `save_pretrained()` but tell that method to use `accelerator.save()` instead of `torch.save()`.\n",
